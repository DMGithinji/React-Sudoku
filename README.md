## React Sudoku

A sudoku application built using react, redux, react-hooks and typescript.
project.

In this project, I utilise react-redux and explored the benefits of using react hooks, writing tests & using Typescript in a react application.

The sudoku puzzle is generated and resolved using a recursive backtracking algorithm


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
